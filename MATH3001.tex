\section{Introduction}
This project aims to use the analysis of flood data for multiple floods of a range of rivers as provided under the Freedom of Information Act by the Environment Agency and subsequently analyse the cost benefits of various proposed flood mitigation plans. \\
\textbf{Should I reference Toms' Github or the EA for Aire, Calder and Don data?}\\
Specifically we will explore:\\

\begin{framed}
\begin{itemize}
\item The possible flood mitigation plans that could be used.
\item The 2015 Boxing Day floods of the Rivers Aire, Calder and Don. This analysis will be done by the entire group.
\item The cost benefits of proposed flood mitigation plans to prevent any future floods along these rivers.
\item The 2012 November floods of the River Avon in both Warwick and Stratford-upon-Avon. This analysis will be done individually.
\item The cost benefits of proposed flood mitigation plans to prevent any future floods along the River Avon and specifically in these locales
\end{itemize}
\end{framed}
\textbf{How do I attach graphs, code, excel spreadsheets e.t.c.}\\
"It is estimated that flood damages in England have risen by around 60\% over the past 25 years and already exceed Â£1 billion per year in direct costs to communities and business".\cite{2}

\section{Flood Mitigation}
\subsection{The Meaning of Flood Mitigation}
First of all, it should be made clear what Flood Mitigation actually is. To mitigate a flood is to reduce the amount of flooding, and thereby the damage as a result of such flooding, caused when a river breaks its banks.\\ 
This has been attempted since the very origins of non-nomadic humanity as the negative financial and social repercussions of a large flood (such as loss of property, crops, infrastructure and even life) are severe. Early examples of attempts to mitigate floods include the construction of stilt-houses by the Yue people in Ancient China around 7000 years ago.\cite{1}\\ 
In the modern world, we now have access to a vast array of possible flood mitigation schemes due to factors such as improvements in engineering and the implementation of a centralised  government with access to large sums of money with wich to implement flood mitigation schemes as well as the legal authority with which to do so.\\
In the course of this report, we will be investigating the effectiveness of such schemes at realistically reducing the volume of water discharged during a flood and thereby the cost effectiveness also, in the hopes that policy makers could make use of such analysis when implementing flood mitigation proposals.

\subsection{Possible Methods of Flood Mitigation}
Examples of possible Flood Mitigation strategies include, but are not limited to:\\
\textbf{want to reference Onno here, can I?}
\begin{itemize}
\item High Flood Walls: increases the total volume of water a river can hold before it starts to flood.
\item River-Bed wWdening: similar to high flood walls, it increases the capacity of the river itself.
\item Flood Plain Enhancement: increases the water retention of the ground itself within places at risk of flooding.
\item Natural Flood Management. This method includes examples such as:
\begin{itemize}
\item Tree Planting:  improves the water retention of the ground as trees 'drink' water.
\item Peat Restoration: improves the water retention of the ground.
\item Flow Attenuation Features: includes examples such as 'leaky dams' (like the ones that a beaver colony would build) that slow the flow of the river.
\end{itemize}
\item Sustainable Drainage Systems. This includes: \cite{3}
\begin{itemize}
\item Source Control:
\begin{itemize}
\item Green Roofs: roofs that are comprised of vegetation on top of a drainage system.
\item Rainwater Harvesting: collects rainwater from roofs and thereby prevents the rainwater from contributing to any possible flooding. One such way of harvesting rainwater is the use of water butts, which collects rainwater running off roofs.
\item Permeable Pavements: pavements that allow rainwater to pass through the hard surface (preventing it from gathering and causing any potential flooding) where it will be stored to either be released into the ground at a sustainable rate (i.e. a rate that will not cause the ground to become waterlogged and thereby cause flooding) or into a drainage system that will transport the rainwater away from the immediate vacinity.
\item Soakways: similar to permeable pavements, there aim is to store rainwater run off from a development so it can then be fed into the ground.
\end{itemize}
\item Site Control:
\begin{itemize}
\item Filter Strips: used in order to transport rainwater run off to systems such as soakways or streams.
\item Trenches: similar to filter strips but with the aim of storing rainwater to gradually be released into the ground as opposed to transporting the rainwater to an alternative storage entity.
\item Swales: akin to trenches but whereas trenches are filled with material like rubble, Swales are filled with vegetation and can be used both to store and release water as well as transport it.
\item Bioretention: also known as rain gardens, are shallow bowls in the ground that capture, and more significantly, treat rainwater.
\item Geocellular/Modular Systems: situated below the ground, these, much like permeable pavements, can either infiltrate rainwater run off into the ground or store said run off until it can be transported to a drainage system.
\end{itemize}
\item Regional Control:
\begin{itemize}
\item Infiltration Basins: comparable to bioretention methods, infiltration basins store run off for it to then be released into the ground but do not treat the water.
\item Detention Basins: temporarily store rainwater run off and, through a controlled flow, mitigates the force of the flow.
\item Ponds: unlike infiltration basins, detention basins and bioretention methods, ponds are permanent bodies of water. Ponds mitigate floods if they are low-lying, i.e. they can accept an addition of a high volume of water before they break their banks.
\item Wetlands: marshland, these works by helping to store water before it slowly enters the ground and also by reducing water flow.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\item The drawing down of drinking water reservoirs before predicted heavy rainfall: reduces the total volume of fluid stored in reservoirs thereby allowing said reservoir to accomodate a larger volume of rain fall before it fills up and begins to flood.
\end{itemize}

\section{Analysis of the 2015 Boxing Day floods}
Here, we will be analysing flood data, provided by the {\bf Environment Agency} from the Boxing Day 2015 floods with specific focus give to the Rivers Aire, Calder and Don.\\
Below is Figure 1. In the next section we will be using Figure 1 to explain the features of the graph as our analysis of the flood at different locations uses the same graph but with different inputted data.
\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=.5\linewidth]{Aire-Quadrant_Graph.png}
\caption{Graph detailing the relationship between the Height and Flow Rate of the River Aire during the 2015 Boxing Day floods using data provided by the Environment Agency from the monitoring station 'Armley'.}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Explanation of the Graph}
In order to plot this graph, we used data showing the stage (stage means height) in metres of the River Aire from the beginning of the 25\textsuperscript{th} until the end of the 30\textsuperscript{th} of December 2015 in 15 minute increments.\\ 

\subsubsection{h\textsubscript{t} and h\textsubscript{m}}
The lower left quadrant shows a plot of stage values against their corresponding time values, which are the only two raw data sets used in this graph. \\
Here, $h_t$ is the threshold stage, i.e. the height at which the river burst its banks and began to flood. $h_t$ can be approximated through a variety of approaches, including using online resources such as gaugemap.co.uk to estimate the height at which a river could begin to flood and social media to find pictures of the river beginning to flood and using the time at which these photos were posted to find the corresponding stage value for the estimated time at which the river began flooding. In this case, Professor Onno Bokhove witnessed the River Aire begin to flood around 10:00 on the 26\textsuperscript{th} of Decmber 2015 at Armley in Leeds.\\
$h_m$ is the mean stage of the river after it has begun to flood. We calculated this by taking all the stage values that are numerically larger than $h_t$, adding up all these values and dividing that sum by the number of said values: \[\frac{\Sigma_{i=1}^{n} h_i}{n},\forall h_i\geq h_t\]\\

\subsubsection{Rating Curve}
For each different gauging station, the environment agency can provide rating information which can be used to define a function Q with which the flow rate of the river can be calculated from a given stage. The general function is defined as:
\[{\bf Q}(h)=c(h-a)^b\]
where c, a and b are provided by the Environment Agency and vary for each gauging station and for different stage intervals. For example, the rating information for the River Aire's Armley station is:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|}
\hline
Lower Stage Limit {[}m{]} & Upper Stage Limit {[}m{]} & c & b & a \\
\hline
0.2 & 0.685 & 30.69 & 1.115 & 0.156 \\
0.685 & 1.917 & 27.884 & 1.462 & 0.028 \\
1.917 & 4.17 & 30.127 & 1.502 & 0.153 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
By running each of our stage values through {\bf Q}(h) as defined for the desired time segment, we compiled a set of time values, their corresponding stage values and their corresponding flow rate values also. This allowed us to plot the rating curve (in the upper right quadrant) and also to plot the flow rate against the time values (in the upper left quadrant). \\
As the provided final upper stage of the rating curve is said to be 4.17 but our maximum stage value is clearly above this, we have had to extrapolate this total upper stage limit to include stage values larger than 4.17.

\subsubsection{Q\textsubscript{t} and Q\textsubscript{m}}
We have now defined the meaning of {\bf Q}(h) and so it is very simple to derive Q\textsubscript{t} as being {\bf Q}(h\textsubscript{t}) and, simlarly, Q\textsubscript{m} as being {\bf Q}(h\textsubscript{m}). As h\textsubscript{t} is 3.90, we use the c, b and a values as defined in the last row of our rating information table.

\subsubsection{T\textsubscript{f} and F.E.V.}
As we have deduced the time, stage and flow rate at which the river begins to flood, it is logical to think that the time from which the flow rate increases above Q\textsubscript{t} to when the flow rate decreases back below Q\textsubscript{t} is the length of time for which the river is actively flooding. This is said to be T\textsubscript{f}.\\ 
It is therefore sensible to assume that the excess flow rate (i.e. the collective flow rate values above our threshold flow rate (Q\textsubscript{t})) multiplied by the length of the flood (T\textsubscript{f}) gives the Flood Excess Volume (F.E.V). This is the excess volume of water above that maximal capacity of the river that is actually causing the flood and can be seen on our graph as the shaded area between {\bf Q}(h) and Q\textsubscript{t} for the duration of the flood.\\
A good approximation of the F.E.V. can be found using our mean excess flow rate (Q\textsubscript{m}) and multiplying this by T\textsubscript{f}:
\[{\bf F.E.V.}\approx\ T_f (Q_m - Q_t)\]
This constitutes the area of the bold box connecting Q\textsubscript{m}, Q\textsubscript{t} and T\textsubscript{f} on our graph.
