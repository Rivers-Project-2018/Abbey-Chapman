\section{Introduction}
Major flooding events have had a huge detremental affect on the UKs' economy, its business and the community at large{;} ``In England and Wales alone, over 4 million people and properties valued at over Â£200 billion are at risk'' \cite{foresight} while the cost of the flooding across the UK on Boxing Day 2015 was estimated to have topped \pounds5 billion nationwide \cite{telegraph}. Thus, this project aims to use the analysis of flood data from the floods of a range of rivers and subsequently assess, by means of flood-excess volume, the cost efficacy of various proposed and hypothetical flood-mitigation policy with the aim of assisting policy makers, businesses and the general public in reducing the negative affects of floods. One way of achieving this, besides the creation of this report, is to produce an automated code that can produce a value for the flood-excess volume of any flood, thereby allowing policy makers and the general public to analyse floods using flood-excess volume which may be pertinent their interests or to investigate methods of mitigating, or even preventing, future flooding in their area.

Flood-excess volume can be simplisticly defined as the difference between the total volume of water discharged at a certain spatial location on a river during the time it is in flood and the maximum volume capacity of the river at this location when not in flood \cite{Aire}. This makes the flood-excess volume the volume of flood water that is actively causing flooding at that location on the river and therefore, by quantifying the volume of water a certain flood-mitigation policy reduces a flood by as well as the cost of implementing it, it is possible to to evaluate the percentage of flood-excess volume mitigated by said policy. The cost per percent of flood-excess volume mitigated of each policy can then be calculated and it is this method of analyzation that will be employed in this report.

To mitigate a flood is to reduce the amount of flooding, and thereby the damage as a result of such flooding, caused when a river breaks its banks. Flood-mitigation has been attempted since the very origins of non-nomadic humanity as the negative financial and social repercussions of a large flood (such as loss of property, crops, infrastructure and even life) are severe. Early examples of attempts to mitigate floods include the construction of stilt-houses by the Yue people in Ancient China around 7000 years ago \cite{yue}. In the modern world there are many different methods of flood-mitigation that can be used which include: Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems (SuDS), Natural Flood Management (NFM), the building of dams, high flood walls or barriers, river bed widening and the drawing down of drinking water reservoirs before predicted heavy rainfall. Each of these stated methods that will be further explored as part of this report.

As the integral work forming the basis of some sections in this report was performed as part of a team (comprised of A. Feilden, S. Kennet, M. Saunders, J. Willis and A. Chapman), an outline of the report is included below, hightlighting which sections were produced individually and which as part of the wider team.
\begin{framed}
\begin{itemize}
\item A review on the concept of flood-excess volume, introduced above, is performed in \S 2. This has been interperted individually by the author based on the work performed by O. Bokhove, T. Kent and M. Kelmanson in \cite{Aire} and \cite{Calder-Don}.
\item Analysis of the 2015 Boxing Day flooding of two rivers, the Rivers Aire in Leeds and Calder in Mytholmroyd, within the county of West Yorkshire is included in \S 3. This analysis includes calculation of flood-excess volume and based on this an assessment of various proposed flood-mitigation measures is performed. The original analysis and assessment was performed by the whole team, with the assistance of O. Bokhove and T. Kent.
\item \S 4 includes the same processes of analysis and assessment as \S 3 but for the 2007 floods along the River Don in Sheffield. Again, this was performed by the team.
\item The rest of the report includes analysis and assessment individually performed by the author. \S 5 includes the calculation of the flood-excess volume for the November 2012 floods along the River Avon, looking at two locations along the river{;} Stratford-upon-Avon and Warwick. Also included is the flood-excess volume calculated by A. Fielden as a verification of the authors results.
\item Having analysed flooding of the River Avon in \S 5, \S 6 contains assessment of both proposed and hypothetical flood-mitigation scenarios, using the flood-excess volumes calculated in \S 5.
\item A summary of the report is in \S 7 and conclusions from the report are drawn there. Acknowledgements and suggested further reading, including a web page created by the team giving instructions on how the geberal public can calculate the flood-excess volume for themselves, is also included here.
\end{itemize}

\section{Definition of flood-excess volume}
The flood-excess volume (henceforth abbreviated to FEV) is defined to be the volume of flood water that causes flooding at a specified location along a flooded river. FEV is therefore dependant on the threshold river level $h_T$. The definition of $h_T$ is the maximum level a river can reach without flooding{;} i.e. the river floods if the in situ river level $\overline{h}$ rises above $h_T$. The flow rate $Q$ is given from a pre determined rating curve which gives $Q$ as a function of $\overline{h}$. All the floods analysed as part of this report have the same equation relating $Q$ and $\overline{h}$
\begin{equation}\tag{2.1}
Q(\overline{h})=c_k (\overline{h}-a_k )^{b_k},\text{ }k=1,...,m,
\end{equation}
where the rating curve coefficients $a_k$, $b_k$ and $c_k$ are provided by the Environment Agency via email. The dimension of $a_k$ must be the same as the river level $\overline{h}$ it is being subtracted from, i.e. m$^3$. As $b_k$ is a power, it must be dimensionless which then forces $c_k$ to have dimension m$^{3-b_k}$/s in order for the dimension of the right side of the equation to match the dimention of the left, [$Q(\overline{h})$]= m$^3$/s. Each value of k corresponds to a range of $\overline{h}$ values, i.e. $h_{k-1}<\overline{h}<h_k$. During flooding events the maximum river level achieved is often higher than the upper bound of the last interval at which point the upper bound can be extrapolated to the maximum value of $\overline{h}$. As $\overline{h}=\overline{h}(t)$, the rating curve $Q=Q(\overline{h})$ means that the flow rate $Q$ can be found implicitly to be a function of time{;} $Q(\overline{h}(t))=Q(t)$.

\subsection{Approximations of the flood-excess volume}
FEV can be approximated using three different methods, each of varying accuracy. It should be noted that as the FEV is a volume it is in units of m$^3$. The total volume $V$ discharged by a river with flow rate $Q(\overline{h})$ over a given time interval can be approximated as
\begin{equation}\tag{2.1\textit{a}}
V\approx \sum_{i=1}^{n}(Q(\overline{h}_i))\Delta t,
\end{equation}
where n is the number of values for $Q(\overline{h})$ within the time interval and t is the time elapsed between each value of $Q(\overline{h})$. As the FEV ($V_e$) is defined as the excess volume discharged by the river once it has reach a level above $h_T$ until it is back below $h_T$, equation 2.1\textit{a} can easily be used to provide the best approximation for FEV
\begin{equation}\tag{2.1\textit{b}}
V_e\approx V_{e_1} = \sum_{i=1}^{n}(Q(\overline{h}_i)-Q_T)\Delta t,
\end{equation}
where $Q_T=Q(h_T)$ is constant as $h_T$ is a fixed value. In this case, n is the number of $Q(\overline{h})$ values from when the river level $\overline{h}$ goes above $h_T$ until it is back below $h_T$. The time that this takes is therefore the equivalent of the duration of the flood $T_f$. The time interval between subsequent $Q(\overline{h})$ values is thus $\Delta t=T_f/n$ and so as $n \to \infty$, $\Delta t \to 0$ this approximation becomes the exact area between the curve $Q(\overline{h})$ and the constant value $Q_T$, seen to be the shaded area inn Figure 1 b).

A second, less accurate, approximation of $V_e$ is given to be the area of the emboldened rectangle in Figure 1 b)
\begin{equation}\tag{2.1\textit{c}}
V_e \approx V_{e_2} = T_f(Q_m-Q_T),
\end{equation}
where $Q(h_m)=Q_m$ is the mean flow rate above $Q_T$. $Q_m$ can be found relatively accurately for each of the floods analysed by first finding the FEV using equation 2.1\textit{b} and then rearranging equation 2.1\textit{c} so that
\begin{equation}\tag{2.1\textit{d}}
Q_m\approx \frac{V_e}{T_f}+Q_T,
\end{equation}
from which $h_m$ is then found by rearranging equation 2.1.

The least accurate third approximation of $V_e$ is
\begin{equation}\tag{2.1\textit{e}}
V_e\approx V_{e_3}=(h_m-h_T)T_f\frac{Q_{max}}{h_{max}}
\end{equation}
which is found because $Q_m\approx (Q_{max}/h_{max})h_m$ and similarly $Q_T\approx (Q_{max}/h_{max})h_T$, approximation mostly used when there is no rating curve that explicitly gives $Q(\overline{h})$ \cite{Calder-Don}. $h_{max}$ and $Q_{max}$ stand for the maximum river level and flow rate value achieved during the period being analysed respectively. 

All FEVs calculated for the five floods analysed in this report have been calculated using the most accurate approximation, equation 2.1\textit{a}, given a $\Delta t$ of 15 minutes.

The top-left quadrant displays the rating curve (using data provided by Table 1) alongside its linear approximation (the blue dashed line), whilst the top-right and bottom-left quadrants display the river height ($\overline{h}$[m]) and flow rate ($Q$ [m$^3$/s]), respectively, during the floods. FEV is then the blue area below the flow rate curve (a function of $\overline{h}$, $Q(\overline{h})$, obtained from the rating curve) and above the flow rate corresponding to a given threshold height, $Q_T =Q(h_T)$. $\overline{h}=\overline{h}(t)$, where t is the number of days after the 25\textsuperscript{th} of December 2015, meaning $Q(\overline{h})=Q(t)$. Equation 2.1\textit{a} is applied to provide $V_e \approx V_{e_1}$= 9.34Mm$^3$, the blue shaded area. The emboldened rectangle approximates the FEV using equation 2.1\textit{c} so that $V_{e_2}= (Q_m -Q_T )\cdot T_f \approx V_{e_1}$= 9.34Mm$^3$, thereby providing an approximation of $Q_m$ given fixed $Q_T$=219.1m$^3$/s and calculated $T_f$=32 hours. Rearranging the rating curve equation 2.1 will provide an evaluation of $h_m$=4.77m from $Q_m$.}

\section{Summary and discussion}

\subsection{Futher Reading}
The main source of information in regards to the flood-excess volume analysis used in this report was provided from the two articles \cite{Aire} and \cite{Calder-Don}, co-authored by the supervisors of this project, O. Bokhove and T. Kent. As such it would be beneficial to read these articles if there is a wish gain a broader understanding of the subject. Detailed information on the various methods of NFM is provided by the Environment Agency in \cite{nfm}. More information on what may happen in the future in regards to flood management nation wide is included \cite{foresight}, produced by the Flood and Coastal Defence project of the Foresight programme.

As part of this project the author, with the assistance of A. Feliden, S. Kennet, M. Saunder and J. Willis, has created a web page containing all the instruction need to perform the same FEV analysis as in this report. This includes as automated code, written by the author, which only needs the parameters of the rating curve and a chose $h_T$ to produce a graph and provide an evaluation of the FEV, $Q_m$, $Q_T$, $h_m$ and $T_f$. The code and the graph it produces may be found in the Appendix. There are some limits to the automated nature of this code, such as the fact that if the curve $Q(\overline{h})$ is split into more than one peak above $Q_T$ then, although the FEV calculated will be accurate, $T_f$ and thereby $Q_m$ and $h_m$ will not. The code also will not work if the flood data being analysed does not cover an integer number of days. Therefore, if this project were to be continued, fixing these issues would be strived for.
